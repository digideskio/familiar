☄ KNOWN ISSUES ☄

Several apparently identical characters used in band names are actually different codepoints, for example ∆ in '†∆†' (U+2206 INCREMENT) vs Δ in 'Δressed Up Like Δogs' (U+0394 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA). The character used can vary between different tags for the same band, unsurprisingly. I recommend removing visually similar characters from the alphabet string and handling ambiguities on the backend.
